## Installation

To install **ForgeMath**, ensure you have **Node.js** installed (version 16.0 or higher), and then run the following command:

```bash
npm install @tryforge/forgemath
```

## Available Functions

**ForgeMath** covers functions from A to Z, including but not limited to:

- Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `atan2`, etc.
- Hyperbolic functions: `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`
- Exponentiation and logarithms: `exp`, `log`, `log10`
- Algebraic functions: `sqrt`, `cbrt`, `pow`
- Rounding functions: `round`, `floor`, `ceil`
- And many more!

## Limitations

Currently, **ForgeMath** supports standard mathematical operations but does not handle symbolic math or algebraic simplifications.

> Note: ForgeMath reads computations **top-down**, ensuring accuracy but not supporting recursive functions yet.
